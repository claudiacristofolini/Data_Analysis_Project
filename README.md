This repository contains the project developed for the Data Analysis course. The aim of the project is to analyze a sales dataset using the techniques and tools studied during the course.

The dataset used for the analysis is sales.csv, while the R code developed for the project is contained in the Script.R file.

The PDF document Analysis-of-Sales-Dataset includes the complete script with the executed code and related outputs.

The document Supermarket_sales_data_analysis_Report presents a detailed report describing the methodology, logic, and steps followed throughout the data analysis process.

Finally, the PDF presentation represents our discussion in class.
